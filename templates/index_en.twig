            The bicycle was created by the German baron <i>Karl Drais von Sauerbronn</i> in 1817. The bicycle is a
            human-powered land vehicle that falls into the category of cycles and is composed of two aligned wheels,
            which give it its name.

            The driving force is provided by the driver (called the "rider"), usually in a seated position, through two
            pedals driving the rear wheel by a roller chain.
        </p>
        <p>
            The front wheel is the steering wheel and ensures the balance. Its orientation is controlled by a handlebar,
            which the cyclist uses to control the trajectory as well as the braking (except for special models) and
            possibly the gear change.
        </p>

            The bicycle is one of the main means of transportation in many parts of the world. Its energy efficiency is
            particularly high. Its practice, cycling, is at the same time a daily use of transport, a popular leisure
            and a and a sport.
