    However, no snow all year round in Europe... The fat bike conquered the nature lovers thanks to its tires and 
    its studs of 4 to 5 inches wide, allowing an optimal grip. It is in fact a particular all-terrain bike able to 
    pass as well rough terrain as well as sandy or snowy ground.', "numeros2" => 'The practice of Fatbike remains an 
    interesting alternative to an ordinary mountain bike practice. It is especially for cyclists who have to face 
    harsh environments all year round, such as in the mountains. Because of their simple design, the absence of complex
    pivot points and generally of suspension, FatBikes are rustic and durable bikes. Little maintenance is required on
    these bikes and therefore, they can also be suitable for riders who do not want to have to repair and adjust their
    bikes every week.'],

    during a descent. In competition, the goal will be to go down the track individually in the least amount of time. It is a sport

    the discs is very large to avoid overheating. overheating.'],

    fun whether it is in the city, in the mountains or in the forest... Everyone has his own definition of Freeride, for some it will be jumping rocky bars of 10 meters, 
    for others riding in complete freedom without any constraint. It\'s a state of mind where the sensations come first. Extreme Freeride is just an evolution of mountain 
    biking towards its most dangerous character. Jumping higher and higher, going faster and faster, the main thing is to feel the adrenaline rush when you take extreme 
    risks.', "numeros2" => 'A Freeride mountain bike generally has a rear suspension for travels between 120 and 150mm. A real comfort asset, the suspension also allows you to 
    take on more demanding trails and routes. Although the term "All-Mountain" mountain bike refers directly to the alpine mountain bike raid, these bikes are also designed 
    for shorter, more reliable rides, and most Freeride bikes are equipped with the latest technology, making them very light despite their suspension systems.'],

    You can for example find yourself facing difficult climbs or descents that require a very specific riding style. Here, you don\'t play with obstacles, you avoid them to go as 
    fast as possible. Because let\'s not forget that the time is often important, and that the goal is to arrive first and beat your best time. It is a race against others, but also
    against yourself, to go beyond your limits. Cross Country is also the only mountain bike discipline present at the Olympics. For history buffs, it has been part of the Olympic 
    Games since 1996. This explains why it is one of the best known sports in the world.', "numeros2" => 'A semi-rigid cross-country mountain bike is a bike with front suspension only, while
    an all-suspension mountain bike is a bike with a front suspension fork and a rear shock. It\'s all about choosing the suspension that best suits your riding and performance goals. 
    The risk with a suspended mountain bike is that the suspension will absorb some of your pedaling energy. If you are looking for a fast, responsive mountain bike to ride faster, to 
    compete in the world championships or to win the French mountain bike cup, you should choose a semi-rigid mountain bike, also called a hardtail.']
